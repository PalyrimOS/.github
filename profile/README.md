PalyrimOS is a LineageOS-based rom that keeps the original idea of a simple user interface with useful additions and light customization.

We focus on performance and adding optimizations that make the user experience better.

Since we use LineageOS as base, if your device has official LOS support you can compile PalyrimOS with the official sources without further complication.
